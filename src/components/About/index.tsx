            <ArticleAbout>
            Hello, I'm Thales, Front End developer, I'm 25 years old, I saw an advertisement 
            for Kenzie Academy Brazil and wanted to sign up, I already wanted to learn programming, 
            I wanted to develop games, when I joined kenzie I fell in love with making codes, and 
            I love Front End, so I studied for that, I developed projects alone, some in a group too, 
            and I want to continue improving myself as a developer, learn even more auxiliary languages 
            to improve myself and because I really like to learn more about Front End, I also want to 
            create bigger projects and more complex and challenge myself more as a developer to be better.
